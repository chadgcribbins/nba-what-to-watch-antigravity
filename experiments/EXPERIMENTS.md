# NBA Watchability - Implementation Experiments

This folder contains alternative implementations of the NBA Watchability app, built with different AI coding assistants to compare approaches, code quality, and development experience.

## Overview

**Original PRD:** See `/PRD.md` in project root

**Goal:** Compare implementation quality, development speed, and code patterns across different AI coding assistants.

## Methodology

Each implementation was built:
1. Using the same PRD
2. With the same initial requirements
3. In isolated sessions
4. With minimal copy/paste between implementations

This provides a fair comparison of:
- AI assistant capabilities
- Generated code patterns
- Development workflow
- Final code quality

---

## Using These Experiments

These implementations are kept as:
- **Learning references** - Compare approaches
- **Pattern library** - See different solutions to same problems
- **Training material** - Show others how different AI tools approach the same task

**Note:** The main implementation (Antigravity) is the only actively maintained version.
